# multiCABS: Conduct conditional adaptive bayesian spectral analysis of replicated multivariate time series

Implements the procedure introduced in the paper
Zeda Li, Scott A. Bruce, Clinton J. Wutzke, and Yang Long "Conditional Adaptive Bayesian Spectral Analysis of Replicated Multivariate Time Series"
*Note that this folder contains code that implements HMC sampler, the other folders contains codes for NUT sampler.


Use DEMO.m as an illustration.

The following inputs are necessary to run the proposed method:

‘zt’ is a cell contains N replicated P dimensional time series

'uu' is a N-dimensional vector contains the covariate values 

‘varargin’ is a set of model parameters, which can be set by the program OptsMultiCABS.m
